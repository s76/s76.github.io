Yesterday we did an internal jam at our office - fuerogames. The jam was short ( 24h instead of tradditional 48h), there were not many people also, only 8 of us, but it was fun, the atmosphere was really good and we all enjoyed.
We divided ourself into 3 teams. I was teamed up with Adam (designer ) and Kasia (2d artist). Despite of being a designer Adam could handle really well graphical stuffs at more than basic level (kudos to him) and Kasia did a good job as always <3. <br><br>
The jam's theme was "One Aplocalypse" so we decided to make a game where you play god, you bring on the apocalypse by summoning natural disasters to destroy anything lving beings on the ground.<br>
To make it as simple as possible (the time we had was short) we chose meteor as the first natural disaster (we can possibly extend the game by adding other disasters after the jam, but thats another topic). Meteor is eye-caching, its existence itself already tells the players what's the goal of the game- to destroy, so we were fine with having it in our game.<br><br>

## The very-very first prototype

I made it really quick so that all could have a vision of what we were heading to. Took me likes 15 minutes to make the scene, create placeholder assets, implement basic collision detection and camera movement. After seeing it we all were like - good enough, replace with graphics and it's done, here is our game, we can go home :D.<br>

## The village
![the village][image-village]
By using Poisson-Disc Sampling algorithm I created a nice distribution of houses over the plane. Lovely houses - ready to be burnt down \*evil smile\*.<br>

## The very first hooman

Since the game happens in 3d space but we only have 2d graphics so we thought billboard graphic style can be good here, took Dont Starve as the reference. It turned out to be fine, I liked it. I also added the very first human on the planet, with the Idle action implemented, he was running happily, not knowing about the upcoming apocalypse \*broad evil smile\*. I named him .. Adam, you know why hehe (I didnt tell Adam-the designer about this though \*cough cough\*).<br>

## The happy village

Once uppon a time, there was a village where ppl spent time together, singing, dancing, having a care-free life.<br>

## The apocalypse

But like every story, it comes to an end. The meteors falling down from sky kill everyone. Runnnnnn........<br>
Joke aside, the meteor looked then ridiculously small because of the plane being scaled up few times.<br>

## Human's next action: repair
![human repairs][image-human-repair]
The second action that human is capable of is reparing. When houses get damages, the human will automatically run to it and repair.<br>

## The user interface
![user interface][image-user-interface]
A pretty user interface mockup by Kasia. The intention was to add a "power" bar that indicates the meteor's power which increases over time when player hold down mouse button. Unfortunately we droped this idea later.<br>

## Trees
![trees][image-trees]
Added trees, there were a few variants of them. Looks nice, doesn't it? <br>

My documentation ended here because I just didnt have enough strength do it after hours of work but we managed to finish the game, I will update the media in the next part when I have time. Prepare to be amazed, the change is huge :D<br>
